  *
  * @brief PWM & Current Feedback components of the Motor Control SDK
  *
  * These components fulfill two functions in a Motor Control subsystem:
  *
  * - The generation of the Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation on the motor's phases
  * - The sampling of the actual motor's phases current
  *
  * Both these features are closely related as the instants when the values of the phase currents
  * should be sampled by the ADC channels are basically triggered by the timers used to generate
  * the duty cycles for the PWM.
  *
  * Several implementation of PWM and Current Feedback components are provided by the Motor Control
  * SDK to account for the specificities of the application:
  *
  * - The selected MCU: the number of ADCs available on a given MCU, the presence of internal
  * comparators or OpAmps, for instance, lead to different implementation of this feature
  * - The Current sensing topology also has an impact on the firmware: implementations are provided
  * for Insulated Current Sensors, Single Shunt and Three Shunt resistors current sensing topologies
  *
  * The choice of the implementation mostly depend on these two factors and is performed by the
  * Motor Control Workbench tool.
  *
  * All these implementations are built on a base PWM & Current Feedback component that they extend
  * and that provides the functions and data that are common to all of them. This base component is
  * never used directly as it does not provide a complete implementation of the features. Rather,
  * its handle structure (PWMC_Handle) is reused by all the PWM & Current Feedback specific
  * implementations and the functions it provides form the API of the PWM and Current feedback feature.
  * Calling them results in calling functions of the component that actually implement the feature.
  * See PWMC_Handle for more details on this mechanism.
